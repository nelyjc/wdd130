        <p>Hello! My name is Nely Crespin and I live in Springville, UT. I am originally from Jalisco, Mexico. 
            I've lived in Utah for 25 years. I enjoy spending time with my family of 5. My husband and I have 3 kids, 2 girls and one boy. 
             My husband and I have recently come back from living in Nebraska for 1 year. Nebraska is beautiful and we loved living there. 
            The Winter Quarters Temple is small but charming. We hope to go back one day. 
            I have an interest in programming and I was told of this program through a friend from our small ward in Nebraska.
            I applied while in Nebraska and started classes when we got back to Utah. I have been loving classes so far and I hope to 
            work in this field after graduation. My husband is an electrical engineer and he has coworkers that are woman and that really piqued
            my interest because when I graduated high school, women in engineering wasn't heard of. I feel like times have changed and now its more common. 
            It has helped me see that woman can be anything they set their mind to. I love how our church also promotes that and helps women get a degree. </p>
